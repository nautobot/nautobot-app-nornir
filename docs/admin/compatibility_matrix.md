# Deprecation Policy

While that last supported version will not be strictly enforced--via the max_version setting, any issues with an updated Nautobot supported version in a minor release, will require a bug to be raised and a fix in Nautobot core to address, with no fixes expected in this plugin. This allows the Nautobot Nornir Plugin the ability to quickly take advantage of the latest features.
