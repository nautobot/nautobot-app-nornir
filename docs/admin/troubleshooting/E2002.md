# E2002 Details

## Message emitted:

`E2002: A valid credentials class path (as defined by Django&#39;s import_string function) is required, but got {credentials_class} which is not importable. See https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-nornir#credentials for details.`

## Description:

The credentials class path is not importable.

## Troubleshooting:

The credentials class path is not importable. Review the credentials class path and ensure that it is importable. This must be importable by Django&#39;s import_string function, which may not be the same as your local shell environment, depending on how your setup your system.

## Recommendation:

Ensure that the credentials class path is importable from the nautobot and worker service.
