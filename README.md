# ntc-nautobot-plugin-nornir

A plugin for [Nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot), that intends to be a small shim layer between
[nornir-nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nornir-nautobot) and other plugins. The primary abilities that the plugin provides is a native Nornir
ORM based inventory and a credential manager.

![Architecture Overview](./docs/img/architecture-overview.png)

As of the writing of this readme, the only plugin leveraging this plugin is the [golden-config](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-golden-config). However, future plugins are planned, such as the "network importer".

That being said, there is currently little reason to install this plugin by itself, without an enabler, which can be seen represented as the white
rectangles inside the yellow rectangle in the diagram above. An enabler could be a Plugin, Job, or another piece of code like a Chatops command.

# Installation

If using the installation pattern from the Nautobot Documentation, you will need sudo to the `nautobot` user before installing so that you install the package into the Nautobot virtual environment.

```no-highlight
sudo -iu nautobot
```

The plugin is available as a Python package in PyPI and can be installed with `pip3`.

```no-highlight
$ pip3 install nautobot-plugin-nornir
```

To ensure the plugin is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (or append if it already exists) in the [`NAUTOBOT_ROOT`](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/optional-settings/#nautobot_root) directory and list the `nautobot-plugin-nornir` package:

```no-highlight
$ echo nautobot-plugin-nornir >> $NAUTOBOT_ROOT/local_requirements.txt
```

> The plugin is compatible with Nautobot 1.0.0 and higher
 
Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your `nautobot_config.py`

```python
# In your nautobot_config.py
PLUGINS = ["nautobot_plugin_nornir"]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "nautobot_plugin_nornir": {
        "use_config_context": {"secrets", False, "connection_options": True},
        # Optionally set global connection options.
        "connection_options": {
            "napalm": {
                "extras": {
                    "optional_args": {"global_delay_factor": 1},
                },
            },
            "netmiko": {
                "extras": {
                    "global_delay_factor": 1,
                },
            },
        },
        "nornir_settings": {
            "credentials": "nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.env_vars.CredentialsEnvVars",
            "runner": {
                "plugin": "threaded",
                "options": {
                    "num_workers": 20,
                },
            },
        },
    }
}
```

Alternatively you can use the `CredentialsSettingsVars` class to set the username and password via settings.

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "nautobot_plugin_nornir": {
        # ...
        "dispatcher_mapping": None,
        "username": "ntc",
        "password": "password123",
        "secret": "password123",
    }
}
```
The plugin behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings. 

| Key     | Example | Default | Description                          |
| ------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| nornir_settings | {"nornir_settings": { "credentials": "cred_path"}} | N/A | The expected configuration paramters that Nornir uses, see Nornir documentation. |
| dispatcher_mapping | {"newos": "dispatcher.newos"} | None | A dictionary in which the key is a platform slug and the value is the import path of the dispatcher in string format |
| username | ntc | N/A | The username when leveraging the `CredentialsSettingsVars` credential provider. |
| password | password123 | N/A | The password when leveraging the `CredentialsSettingsVars` credential provider. |
| secret | password123 | N/A | The secret password when leveraging the `CredentialsSettingsVars` credential provider.|
| connection_options | N/A | {"netmiko": {"extras": {"global_delay_factor": 1}}} | Set Nornir connection options globally to be used with **all** connections.
| use_config_context | {"secrets": True, "connection_options": True} | {"secrets": False, "connection_options": False} | Whether to pull Secret Access Type, and/or Connection Options from Config Context.|


The plugin behavior can be extended further with [config context](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/extras/gitrepository/#configuration-contexts) data. The plugin currently implements two options: Nornir connection options, and secrets.  The supported settings are listed below.

The root key for this plugin is `nautobot_plugin_nornir`.

| Key     | Description                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| connection_options | Dictionary representation of a Nornir Plugins connection options. |
| connection_secret_path | Dotted expression of the dictionary path where a device secret should be stored for a given Nornir Plugin. |
| secret_access_type | Type of Secret Access Type to use. Examples. "GENERIC", "CONSOLE", "GNMI", "HTTP", "NETCONF", "REST", "RESTCONF", "SNMP", "SSH"|

By default the device secret connection option path will be set for connections using: Napalm, Netmiko, and Scrapli.  If an additional path needs to be registered it can be done by setting it inside the config context data.  See below for an example.

```yaml
---
_metadata:
  name: spine
  weight: 1000
  description: Group Definitions for device type SPINE
  is_active: true
  device-roles:
    - slug: spine
nautobot_plugin_nornir:
  pluginx:
    connection_secret_path: "pluginx.extras.secret"
```

Finally, as root, restart Nautobot and the Nautobot worker.

```no-highlight
$ sudo systemctl restart nautobot nautobot-worker
```

## Setting `dispatcher_mapping`

The `dispatcher_mapping` configuration option can be set to extend or map the platform slug to a proper nornir class.

```json
 {
  "dispatcher_mapping": {
    "newos": "dispatcher.newos",
    "ios": "nornir_nautobot.plugins.tasks.dispatcher.cisco_ios.NautobotNornirDriver",
    "ios_xe": "nornir_nautobot.plugins.tasks.dispatcher.cisco_ios.NautobotNornirDriver",
    "fortinet": "nornir_nautobot.plugins.tasks.dispatcher.default.NetmikoNautobotNornirDriver",
  }
}
```

The above example demonstrates the following use cases.

* Creating a custom only local dispatcher
* Mapping a user defined and preferred platform slug name to expected driver (e.g. ios -> cisco_ios)
* Overloading platform slug keys, by mapping ios and ios_xe to the same class
* Leveraging the existing "default" Netmiko driver

Plugin developers that leverage the plugin, are recommended to use the `get_dispatcher` function in `nautobot_plugin_nornir.utils` file to provide the ability to
allow users to define their own mappings as described above.

# Inventory

The Nautobot ORM inventory is rather static in nature at this point. The user has the ability to define the `default` data. The native capabilities
include. 

* Providing an object called within the `obj` key that is a Nautobot `Device` object instance.
* Provide additional keys for hostname, name, id, type, site, role, config_context, and custom_field_data.
* Provide grouping for global, site, role, type, and manufacturer based on their slug.
* Provide credentials for NAPALM and Netmiko.
* Link to the credential class as defined by the `nornir_settings['settings']` definition.

  - Enabling the use of Config Context:
  ```python
  PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
  "nautobot_plugin_nornir": {
    "use_config_context": {"connection_options": True},
    "nornir_settings": {
      "credentials": "nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.nautobot_secrets.CredentialsNautobotSecrets",
      # ...
    }
  }
  }
  ```

  - Local Device Config Context:
    ```json
    {"nautobot_plugin_nornir": {
            "connection_options": {
                "napalm": {
                    "extras": {
                        "optional_args": {
                            "global_delay_factor": 5
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
  ```
  
  - Device Type Config Context:
  ```yaml
  ---
  _metadata:
    name: spine
    weight: 1000
    description: Group Definitions for device type SPINE
    is_active: true
    device-roles:
      - slug: spine
  nautobot_plugin_nornir:
    connection_options:
      napalm:
        extras:
          optional_args:
            global_delay_factor: 5
  ```

# Credentials

There is a `NautobotORMCredentials` class that describes what methods a Nautobot Nornir credential class should have.

```python
class NautobotORMCredentials:
    """Abstract Credentials Class designed to work with Nautobot ORM."""

    def get_device_creds(self, device):
        """Return the credentials for a given device.

        Args:
            device (dcim.models.Device): Nautobot device object

        Return:
            username (string):
            password (string):
            secret (string):
        """
        return (None, None, None)

    def get_group_creds(self, group_name):
        """Return the credentials for a given group.

        Args:
            group_name (string): Name of the group

        Return:
            string: username
            string: password
            string: secret
        """
        return (None, None, None)
```

Any custom credential class should inherit from this model and provide get_device_creds and/or get_group_creds methods. Currently, only the
get_device_creds is used. Building your own custom credential class allows users to control their own credential destiny. As an example, a user could
integrate with their own vaulting system, and obtain credentials that way. To provide a simple but concrete example.

```python
class CustomNautobotORMCredentials(NautobotORMCredentials):

    def get_device_creds(self, device):
        if device.startswith('csr'):
            return ("cisco", "cisco123", None)
        return ("net-admin", "ops123", None)
```

You would have to set your `nornir_settings['credentials']` path to your custom class, such as `local_plugin.creds.CustomNautobotORMCredentials`.

Out of the box, users have access to three classes:

- `nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.settings_vars.CredentialsSettingsVars`
  - Leverages the username, password, secret that is specified in the plugin configuration.
- `nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.env_vars.CredentialsEnvVars`
  - Leverages the environment variables `NAPALM_USERNAME`, `NAPALM_PASSWORD`, and `DEVICE_SECRET`.
- `nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.nautobot_secrets.CredentialsNautobotSecrets`
  - Leverages the [Nautobot Secrets Group](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-functionality/secrets/#secrets-groups) core functionality.  **The default assumes Secrets Group contain secrets with "Access Type" of `Generic`** and expects these secrets to have "Secret Type" of `username`, `password`, and optionally `secret`. The "Access Type" is configurable via the plugin configuration parameter `use_config_context`, which if enabled changes the plugin functionality to pull `device_obj.get_config_context()['nautobot_plugin_nornir']['secret_access_type']` from each devices config_context. Which is the config context dictionary `nautobot_plugin_nornir` and the subkey of `secret_access_type`.

  - Enabling the use of Config Context:
  ```python
  PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
  "nautobot_plugin_nornir": {
    "use_config_context": {"secrets": True},
    "nornir_settings": {
      "credentials": "nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.nautobot_secrets.CredentialsNautobotSecrets",
      # ...
    }
  }
  }
  ```

  - Local Device Config Context:
  ```json
  {"nautobot_plugin_nornir": {"secret_access_type": "SSH"}}
  ```
  
  - Device Type Config Context:
  ```yaml
  ---
  _metadata:
    name: spine
    weight: 1000
    description: Group Definitions for device type SPINE
    is_active: true
    device-roles:
      - slug: spine
  nautobot_plugin_nornir:
    secret_access_type: SSH
  ```

> For any of these classes, if a "secret" value is not defined, the "password" will also be used as the "secret" value.

The environment variable must be accessible on the web service. This often means simply exporting the environment variable will not 
suffice, but instead requiring users to update the `nautobot.service` file, however this will ultimately depend on your own setup. Environment
variables are distinctively not nautobot configuration parameters (in `naubot_config.py`), if that does not makes sense, expect to see authentication issues.

```
[Service]
Environment="NAPALM_USERNAME=ntc"
Environment="NAPALM_PASSWORD=password123"
Environment="DEVICE_SECRET=password123"
```
